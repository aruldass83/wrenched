== introduction ==

Wrenched is naturally managed by Maven and comes in several projects.

`wrenched-core` and `wrenched-core-swc` are core modules that provide all main features. depend you java back-end on the former and your flex frontend on the latter.

unfortunately transitive SWCs are not resolved correctly, so there're three additional dependencies that must be put in your flex project: `granite-swc`, `floxy` and `flemit`.

apart from these come _adapters_: `hibernate-adapter`, `simple-adapter`, etc. these are certain exclusive SPIs that your java back-end should also be depending on. choose one according to a technology or framework used (Hibernate, JPA, maybe pure CGLIB). adapters are discovered at runtime and therefore don't require any configuration whatsoever. however make sure either there's one on the classpath or you don't need any.
