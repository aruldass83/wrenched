## Wrenched ##

Wrenched is an Adobe BlazeDS extension that currently provides several key features:

  * automated and customizable externalization;

  * built-in support for Maps and Enums;

  * full lazy-loading support that doesn't depend on ORM framework.

additionally Wrenched provides (as a separate project though) a Flex/Java toolkit that (so far) includes:

  * declarative restriction mechanism that allows developers to define and manage rules over Flex components.

  * search screen development components that allow to easily build Flex search screens. no more Java code or queries required to let the users search for data, it can be done by mxml wysiwyg editors.

  * lazy category/tree view (which currently has its own lazy-loading support specific to this component, subject to later change).

more detailed project and usage information is available in wikis, as well as in javadoc source comments.
